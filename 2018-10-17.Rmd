This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

```{r}
a<-c("A, B","B ,C")
a
str_split_fixed(a,", ", n=3)->b
str_c(b)->c
c
table(b)
b
```

```{r}
library(googlesheets)
```
```{r}
gs_auth(new_user = TRUE)
```
```{r}
gsSurvey<-gs_key("4/ewDS4u45xVX6b6LlO0mDZjk7swQ416UnLXN8Iuxz0mIyC2lx7u--kNg")  #download sheet information as an object
classSurvey<-gs_read(gsSurvey,ws=1) #access the 1st worksheet
```



Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
